All file should be COMMA separated with no tabs.
Comments should be included with # at the END of a line
Anything after a # is considered to be a comment
E.g.
4, 5, 6 #, 7, 7 ,8
Will be interpreted as 4, 5, 6

Format of TIMING parameter file is -

Run_Start Run_End	   Bunch_Spacing	CT_Offset	Pion_Prompt_Peak	Kaon_Prompt_Peak	Proton_Prompt_Peak RF_Offset
	  
where values here have beent tab separated for clarity.

Run_Start -> First run number in setting/group
Run_End -> Last run number in setting/group
Bunch_Spacing -> Timing between each beam bucket hitting the target
CT_Offset -> Adjustment to width of prompt timing window, prompt is between PromptPeak -(CT_Offset+Bunch_Spacing/2) and PromptPeak + (CT_Offset+Bunch_Spacing/2), adjust offset if not all of the peak is correctly being included
Pion_Prompt_Peak -> Centroid of the prompt peak for the coin time calculated for pions. Note, you should base this upon the timing peak after PID (but without any BG subtraction)
Pion_Prompt_Peak -> Centroid of the prompt peak for the coin time calculated for kaons. Note, you should base this upon the timing peak after PID (but without any BG subtraction)
Pion_Prompt_Peak -> Centroid of the prompt peak for the coin time calculated for protons. Note, you should base this upon the timing peak after PID (but without any BG subtraction)
RF_Offset -> Offset added to RF_Time difference to try and center all RF distributions (before cuts) at the same point
